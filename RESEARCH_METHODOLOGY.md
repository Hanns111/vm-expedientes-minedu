# ðŸ”¬ Research Methodology - AI Search Platform MINEDU

## Abstract

This document presents the research methodology applied in developing and evaluating a hybrid AI system for governmental document retrieval. The study compares traditional IR methods (TF-IDF, BM25) with modern deep learning approaches (Sentence Transformers) in a production-ready Docker environment.

## Research Questions

**Primary:** How do different information retrieval techniques perform when combined in a hybrid system for governmental document search?

**Secondary:** 
1. What is the optimal weight combination for hybrid ranking fusion?
2. How does processing time correlate with search quality?
3. What are the usability implications of each approach?

## Methodology

### Experimental Design
- **Type:** Comparative experimental study
- **Subjects:** 20 validated queries from MINEDU regulations
- **Metrics:** Token overlap, exact match, length ratio, processing time
- **Validation:** Expert review + statistical significance testing

### Technical Implementation
- **Backend:** FastAPI with async processing
- **Frontend:** Next.js 14 with ChatGPT-like interface
- **Deployment:** Docker + WSL2 optimization
- **Security:** Governmental-grade security implementation

### Evaluation Protocol
```python
# Standardized evaluation for each method
for method in ['tfidf', 'bm25', 'transformers', 'hybrid']:
    results = evaluate_search_engine(method, golden_dataset)
    statistical_analysis(results)
```

## Key Findings

### Performance Comparison
| Method | Token Overlap | Processing Time | Precision@5 |
|--------|--------------|-----------------|-------------|
| TF-IDF | 0.42 Â± 0.15 | 0.052s Â± 0.008s | 0.68 |
| BM25 | 0.45 Â± 0.18 | 0.048s Â± 0.006s | 0.72 |
| Transformers | 0.38 Â± 0.16 | 0.308s Â± 0.045s | 0.65 |
| **Hybrid** | **0.52 Â± 0.14** | 0.145s Â± 0.025s | **0.78** |

### Statistical Significance
- ANOVA F-test: p < 0.05 (statistically significant differences)
- Hybrid system shows 15% improvement over best individual method
- Processing time vs quality trade-off: 3x slower but significantly better results

## Technical Contributions

1. **Hybrid Architecture:** Successfully combines statistical + neural approaches
2. **Production Deployment:** Docker containerization with WSL2 optimization
3. **Security Framework:** Governmental-grade security implementation
4. **Reproducible Results:** Complete codebase and evaluation framework

## Limitations & Future Work

- Limited corpus (single regulation document)
- Small golden dataset (20 queries)
- Scalability testing up to 1000 req/min only
- Future: Multi-domain expansion, LLM integration

## Reproducibility

- **Code:** Available in GitHub repository
- **Data:** Golden dataset and processed documents included
- **Environment:** Docker containers ensure consistent deployment
- **Documentation:** Complete technical and methodological documentation
